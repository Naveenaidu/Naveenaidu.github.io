Dear Sam,

Here I am again writing another experience of my life. Before I go on, I'll just write down the `usual satuatory warning for the readers`. Dear Readers, the following are my opinions and my opinions only. Some of the following content might be harsh and might not suit your taste. And most of the content might not even have a logical connection between them. So if messed up coffee isn't your cup of tea - Then please go on and read my other tech posts. The following post is written just for me to gather my thoughts and emotions and come up with a plan on what to do. 

Now that the WARNING is done. Let's dive in, shall we Sam.

Sam, you have asked me once, why do write my personal stuff and post it online. What if! Someone thinks you are mad or some crazy idiot. Well TBH sam, it doesn't bother me at all. The only reason I post it is beacuse - I know somewhere in this part of the world their is someone who might be in same the confused state I am today and I hope that he stumbles across this and know that it's Okay to feel that way. And there's nothing wrong with him.

Is it weird that I want to write tons of stuff and yet I don't want to write? I sometimes - correction Most of the times, I have never been able to understand what I feel.  That's the reason why I sometimes feel this disconnnection with most of the people around me. I feel guilty of not feeling guilty that I am unable to connect to people. Is it odd that I like to stay alone far away from the crowd - nested in my small little comfortable Rabbit hole writing and talking with my computer. That being said Sam, you do know that I ain't like the kid who people don't know. I do interact with people and people do know me. I just keep my distance from everyone. Is it weird to feel this disconnection with everyone. I just get tired most of the time to put on this facade to face the world with this bright shiny smile. What am I saying!! I put up the smile because I like to put it. I mean, I generally am happy most of the time. Yet I'm sad at the same time. Wow! WHat a weird state.

Being in the zone of happy yet being in the zone of not knowing what the other emotion is. Or am I just complicating things. Are emotions as singular as they are protrayed. I mean either someone is either happy, or sad or funny etc. Is it true that a person can either feel only one of these emotions at any one time. Or are there any emotion which we haven't named and yet we subconsciously try to fit these into those that we know? I don't know, All I do know is - I experienced a tons of situations where the feeling/emotion that I had at a particular instance wasn't able to be classified in any one of the emotions that I can name. It was just a mixture of stuff at the same time. I used to be scared of these instances, I still am - But I still am unable to accept these. Or did I accept thise. Okay! This is getting crazy - i lost track of what I was saying. Lemme recollect my thoughts. 

Oh! So I was saying I guess emotions aren't singular - There are few emotions that we understood about and we named them - But my question is how did we learn to classify our emotions. I mean how do we subconsiously state that the state we are in is either happy or sad. What if there are few emotions that are unexplainable. Do such a thing exist - I don't know. All I know is - There were times I wasn't able to classify what I felt and that scared the shit out of me. I just want you to know Naveen - That it's Okay if you ever feel that way again - Maybe that will help you to understand your inner self better. So when you do come in such a stance next time - embrace it and explore what you want to do. 

Oh Boy!! I really can divert my thought train. Fuck it Sam, Fuck it - I'm gonna write what all i feel. No connection between anything. Just so you know, I'm not drunk (I don't drink :D -- Alcohols is a big NO NO for me and so is smoking). I'm just in those weird moods ( Or my close friends call this `Naveen's periods` - Sorry for being insensitive.) 

So Sam, I do feel Sad and other emo's that I don't understand. But i also feel guilt and ashamed that How can I have the audacity to feel sad when there are people who are in much worse state than me and I am one of the blessed one. Yet those people chose to be happy - So I shouldn't feel sad. That's so stupid of me. Even though I know this - I still feel sad - But I don't want to. I can't and I should not. I am blessed with all that I need - How can I waste my time cribbing and ranting about stuff that are so trivial, when people are in worse situation. That is not acceptable Naveen.  So does this mean, that I have no right to feel sad? I don't think that's what I mean Naveen - You as all Human beings are free to feel what they want to feel - Sometimes these feeling are not under your control ( WHo control's it then - Maybe that's a topic for some other day). But what you have is the choice is how you wanna deal with it. Either keep cribing about it and get up and do work that can subdue the emotion that hurts you. 

I totally agree with what you say Sam - I cannot sit back and let this emotion take over me. But Sammmmm -- It's hard to remain motivated when you are alone. When you see people around you having different ideologies than you and it's hard to stay strong and remain with your idealogy. Now don't give me the shit that - It's hard and not Impossible.Oh My Dear Naveen - No I won't say that sentence though that was the first line that popped in my head :P.  You see Sam, one that thing is I want to learn Sam and absorb as much knowledge as I can so that I can be closer to my ultimate goals - But all I see around me is - People worrying about Placements and have no regard with innovation - All they want is a fucking JOB. I just seek one such person who will come to me and say - naveen let's get onto this fucking exciting project and built it - It'll be awesome. That someone who will push me to my extereme. I'm literally slacking Sam. It's means like 10 days since GSOC and OMP completed and all I have been doing is laying down on the bed and doing nothing. And mind you! It's not because of the feeling that I have accomplished something - But because I'm sulking that I haven't done anything worthy enough. I'm literary lost --- The song is ringing in my head of the `Lost Boy - Peter pan`. 

Fuckkkk! I want to do so many things. So many things  to do and here I am sitting in front of you and Ranting. I fucking want to change the world. Change the world for Good. You know Sam, the weird part is  - Every week I come across a new principle of mine. Some day I want to change the world from proverty by teaching for free, Someday I want to become rich enough to give the poor job and donate to people, Someday I want to save Mother Earth and some other fucking day some other thought.


There are so many problem I want to solve and I'm scared that I would be caught up in my thinking that I won't end up doing anything. And this fear is turning into reality as the day go on. All i do is sulk and think that I want to change the world and YET I **Never** pix up the axe and start cutting down the tree.

Sam, What IF I DOn't end up doing anything. What If I end up living some ordinary life  - Where I get a JOB - A Family - DIE . What if I don't end doing my part in the world. But what is my fucking part in the world. Or does this concept even present. Or are we all just a simple coincidence? And that there is no meaning to our lives. 

FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK FUCKKK FUCCKKKKKKKKKKK Sam, All these fucking emotions are so conflicting with each other that I might explode. If I start thinking about all of them - I get so frustrated, angry, sad and guilty. 

Naveeen, Stop it here. Remember - You aren't a GOD/superhuman. You cannot control and manage everything by yourself. See Naveen, all these are great world problems. You cannot put your foot into everything. You need to take things one at a time. 

I'll tell something about you Naveen-

You are someone who loves technology and loves to learn new stuff and build it. You are someone who like to develop an API rather than use it. You like to go in depth rather than width. In short you love technology. But you are scared that you don't know everything about it and you have FOMO. You dream of getting onto the level of Linus Trovalds, Steve Wozniack, Bill Gates, Elon Musk.

And another part of you want to go all in into Social Service. You look/ dream that someday you'll be the reason of changing the world. You want to walk down the path of selflessness and give off everything you want. You just want to help people stand up on their feets.

The problem I feel is that You have been trying to merge these both into one. You want to merge your thirst of knowledge for new exciting tech with your desire and will to help people. And you ended up coming up ideas that Your code is helping people and that's why you code.

This is also the very reason why you had conflict during GSoC and other projects. You lied and made yourself believe that you are doing it to help people. But in fact - You knew deeply well inside that - You were doing it because you wanted to work and learn tech. That had nothing to do with social service and that's why you ended up feeling sad and guilty half way through.

See naveen, I don't know how we ended up believing that there need to be only one goal we should totally focus our life onto. That basically did not work out for you did it. Having a single goal - Made your superimpose two things which were totally out of phase. This ended up in some huge internal conflicts.

What I feel is Naveen - It's totally Okay to have two seperate goal with no intersection at all. You should not feel guilty about developing apps and programs that in no way might help people around you - which you only do to kindke your fire of inquisitiveness. 

It's completely fine to keep these things seperate.

What i say naveen is to live two lives. One where you put in all your efforts in pursuit of Education and other part where you contribute back to the society. Yes you would have to figure out how you'll do it. Maybe spend the morning time to work on the things you like and during the evening and other free time - Use the knowledge that you gain or just join groups that you like to give your service back to society.

It's totally Okay for you to, have different goals with no intersection.

Thanks Sam, this does clear the fog a little. There are tons and tons of questions that bother me but this was something that I had to understand. Something I will accept that it's okay to have two contrasting dreams. 

Now that I have divided my things into two things:
1. Academic Pursuit
2. Socail Service

I need to tackle both of them seperately.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Academic Pursuits

Remember your dreams Naveen.

You cannot end up being a mediocre. And neither will I be influcened by people following a normal path. I won't sacrifise my dreams. I am going to take risks.
I will not take any Job which pays well - Just because it's the safe thing to do. I want to enter a startup - A energetic startup where I can feel the vibe and see that I do something extraordinary. Where I can work on some exciting tech.

I am losing focus here... 

I dunno what I want to do next - I gotta start thinking what I'll do here. I'll update this part once I do clear up and maybe get the time and mood to continue ahead.

As of now, I lost the track of my thoughts - I'll return back someother day. Only one minor thing has been cleared until now - I also need to understand that something like this - would take many days to write and plan.

Or maybe as usual - I'll end up taking a leap of faith and see where it takes me. But I know one thing for sure - If I want to manage both things I need to plan well. Because Planning is important.


Ciao for now everybody! Have great fun :)
