#### Recap of the day

The day stared out good. Got up a little late around 8:30 am. Could reduce my
sleep. 6 hours sleep should be enough, since I also sleep during the afternoon.
Finished house chores (washing dishes, Sweeping) in the morning. Though I was a
bit annoyed since the past two days, because  I thought that I could use up this
time to do my other work. That assumption was just my childish anger. I would 
have wasted the morning either way in watching TV. It's better to help maa in 
the work and reduce her workload. So I accepted this fact today and I made peace
with this complaint that I had. I feel so childish about this.

Sat down around 11 AM to start my work. Realized that I had not yet made up my 
mind on what to work for and wasted around a hour or so in reddit and the
purposeless checking of my mails. I need to keep track of this habbit in order
to maximize my time.

Worked on Final year project presentation around 3 - 8pm. Finally finished it,
only to know that my ppt had been postponed to saturday. Nevertheless - The
work is done. I can concentrate on FFRouting. 

I still do not have a good idea about FRRouting. I'll start from tomorrow by 
solving smaller issues.

I also finised up my blog. I basically copied what some other user did in order
to make the changes. These were pretty simple. In order to make a new tab in
navbar, all you would need to do is:

1. Append the _/_includes/nav.html_ with a proper href for the new block in navbar
2. Make a new `<new_block_name>.html` file in the root folder, and add what is 
it that you want to do in the pages.

That's it :P You have a new bar

Anyway, Now I gotta go. I'm starting to realise that my folks are getting old
and they are no longer the same people. The time is coming for me to start 
taking care of them. It was a little frustrating to see them this way initially,
but I'm getting used to it. Once you accept the fact that parents are not
superhero and they are human being too and they make mistakes too, I guess you
start to feel them.

I'm signing off now - Gotta go massage dad and mom's legs. That'll help them slep.

Ciao!
