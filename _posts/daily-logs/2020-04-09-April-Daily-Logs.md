#### Recap of the day

The day stared out good. Got up a little late around 8:30 am. Could reduce my
sleep. 6 hours sleep should be enough, since I also sleep during the afternoon.
Finished house chores (washing dishes, Sweeping) in the morning. Though I was a
bit annoyed since the past two days, because  I thought that I could use up this
time to do my other work. That assumption was just my childish anger. I would 
have wasted the morning either way in watching TV. It's better to help maa in 
the work and reduce her workload. So I accepted this fact today and I made peace
with this complaint that I had. I feel so childish about this.

Sat down around 11 AM to start my work. Realized that I had not yet made up my 
mind on what to work for and wasted around a hour or so in reddit and the
purposeless checking of my mails. I need to keep track of this habbit in order
to maximize my time.

Worked on Final year project presentation around 3 - 8pm. Finally finished it,
only to know that my ppt had been postponed to saturday. Nevertheless - The
work is done. I can concentrate on FFRouting. 

I still do not have a good idea about FRRouting. I'll start from tomorrow by 
solving smaller issues.

I also finised up my blog. I basically copied what some other user did in order
to make the changes. These were pretty simple. In order to make a new tab in
navbar, all you would need to do is:

1. Append the _/_includes/nav.html_ with a proper href for the new block in navbar
2. Make a new `<new_block_name>.html` file in the root folder, and add what is 
it that you want to do in the pages.

That's it :P You have a new bar

Anyway, Now I gotta go. I'm starting to realise that my folks are getting old
and they are no longer the same people. The time is coming for me to start 
taking care of them. It was a little frustrating to see them this way initially,
but I'm getting used to it. Once you accept the fact that parents are not
superhero and they are human being too and they make mistakes too, I guess you
start to feel them.

I'm signing off now - Gotta go massage dad and mom's legs. That'll help them slep.

Ciao!

#### Recap of the day
The start of the day was a bit weird. I woke up today to find maa and paa still 
sleeping. That rarely happens. I woke up late too. I did set an alarm for 7AM
but it looks like I overslept. I need to reduce my sleep. 

Waking up late. Things started moving a little slow. Had to go out today to buy
the stuff for home. Normal groceries and stuff. By the time everything was 
settled it was around 12 Noon. I was a little pissed - If I may. Because I wasn't
getting time to work. But I realise now that  it was a wrong emotion. If I don't
help my peeps who would. Also it's not like the I would've worked during that
time. 

I find that really odd. I mean when I do other work - I feel like I could've 
used this time to do something else and be a little angry for not being able to
do the work I like when I'm preoccupied with something else, But then when I get
the free time - I make excuses of not doing the work.

That's really wrong. Something is going wrong there. I don't know what. I need 
better time management. And I gotta stop getting annoyed.

I sometimes really wish for a mentor/friend who shared my same interests. I don't
need a mentor to show me the path. I want him to push me beyond my limits. I 
mean if you see a lot of successfull people, All of them had atleast one
person who made them break their boundaries and challenged them. I don't have any
I need this because, I'm slacking off a lot nowadays. I like putting my brain to
work. But you know, my brain resists. I don't want that. I really want to change
that. But it's hard for me to do it alone. I know I suck at disciplining myself.

I hope someday I find someone who does the same to me. But until then, I have to
try my best to not slack and keep my brain occupied. I cannot end up like those
normal people. I hate to be like that. Not that I hate them - But I just don't
find the point of being normal.

I gotta stop taking naps in the afternoon. I go for a nap of 20 min and I jerk
around 2 hours. That's a waste. Rather - I'll force myself to go to bed only
when I feel really sleepy.

Also I started reading the book Emma by Jane Austen. The language is a bit weird.
Initially I felt it bland, but I forced myself to read a few more chapters in 
the morning and I guess, I'm starting to like it. The character Emma is such a
troublesome lady. She acts as if she's above all the other classes and why the
hell does she keep indulging herself in other people's business. Let's see how
Jane Austen caries her story.

I also started reading Craftin Interpreters book. I am at Chapter 2. It's really
interesting. I think I'll finish the rest of the chapter on my bed. 

Also I realised that I suck at conversing. I barely talk many sentences in a day.
It's like very few. I guess that I'm just a bad talker. My parents deserved a 
better kid then me xD

Ciao for now, Will go finish the remaining chapter 2. And I'll make sure that
I hack atleast one bug in FRR tomorrow. Else, it'll really be hard for me to
work if i get selected for GSoC.
