        <p>Hello There people :)</p>
<p>Welcome to my tiny weeny little space on web. I am Naveen. An undergraduate
student from India. I study Computer Science. I do stuffs with computers and
sometimes write about it here. And when the philosopher in me kicks in, I pen
down my abstract thoughts on various subjects in the world that confuses me. I
also like to write about various life lessons that I learn and sometimes use
this place to brag about myself :P <em>Cough! Cough! If you noticed, I just copy
pasted the description of homepage here :P Engineers are lazy ^^</em></p>
<p><strong>NOTE: I TEND TO WRITE VERY LONG POSTS - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED</strong></p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t believe me but I have been trying to set up the blog post since
past <strong>4 months</strong>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Yeah! You read it right. Fucking 4 months. And I finally set up my blog last
month. <em>Why? Why? Did i take so long to set up one simple blog Not like it&rsquo;s
great or anything.</em> Well, my dear friend. It&rsquo;s not my fault (It never is :P),
Blame the choices. And my high expectations. I tend to do this often.</p>
<p>After reading so many interesting blogs and being mesmerised by their shiny
design I wanted to make a blog similar to them. So I set out on the journey to
create a mind boggling fantastic blog - Something completely out of ordinary.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know where to start. No way on Thano&rsquo;s Earth would I ever resort to
building the website by myself (<em>Insider Fact: I HATE web developement - Never
made sense to me</em>). So I choose the easy way out - <code>Jekyll + Github Pages</code>.
Atleast I thought it was going to be easy, I always underestimate things.
It was PAIN in the ASS. I realised that I really really suck at anything
related to web .And here, I dreamt that one day - I&rsquo;ll get the entire internet
down - There goes my plan down the drain <em>atleast for now</em>.</p>
<p>So yeah! I finally succeded at setting up the Github Page and understanding the
basics of Jekyll. But I still had no themes on it. It was just a normal
<code>Hello World!</code> text. Now Now - comes the actual and real cause of the delay.
<strong>CHOICES</strong> - There were so many interesting choices. Each and every choice
was in someway better than the rest. But nothing really clicked my heart.
Mind You! I set my expectations to a very very high bar. I must also inform you
that I actually tried out 5 jekyll themes before this one xD.
<em>Woah! man</em>. Still, Still - I did not like any of those. I was worrying about
the scalability about the blog.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>Don&rsquo;t Laugh!</em> Every person has the right to dream :P</p>
<p>Back to the story, I was pissed off after a week. Like really really pissed out,
any more theme change and I would literally have a mental breakdown <em>Don&rsquo;t
be so overdramatic dude</em>. Yeah Yeah OKay Fine!. Anyway - I finally decided that
it can&rsquo;t go on this way. Either I need to get my expectations down and become
realistic or I can say Sayonara to my Blog. I did the former. I set down my
expectation, choose a minimalistic theme and here I am blogging.</p>
<p>Hurrah! After 4 months - I had my own webpage and a blog.</p>
<p>Once lesson that I understood from this ordeal is:
<code>JUST DO IT</code>, I realised that we spend most of out time in thinking about the
outcomes and the ways that we want to achieve things, and in this whole process
the implementation get&rsquo;s lost either because we find it very difficult or we
loose our interest.</p>
<p>TL;DR - Don&rsquo;t overthink, If you plan to do something - just put on your shoes
and do it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now, that the story of my setting up of the blog is over. I would just like to
tell you, the reader(<em>I&rsquo;m pretty sure the only person/thing who would read it would
be the bots scrawling over the internet xD</em>) that I would be using this place
to put in all my un organized thoughts. So do not expect any posts to be of
great quality.  I generally do this in my diary but now that i spend most of the
time on my laptop - It&rsquo;s easier this way.</p>
<p>Writing down my abstract ideas have always helped me come to a conclusion. So
that is what I&rsquo;m gonna do here. That being said, I do write some nice stuff.
If you are up for the challenge to read through my abstract ideas and see how
they become clear in the idea, I would be more than happy to welcome you
on-board.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for now - Maybe someother day - I&rsquo;ll let in more about myself.</p>
