Bonjour Copains,

This post has been long overdue. I have been porcastinating for a long time, thanks to my laziness. But I have finally decided that this experience needs to be set in stone, because anything that's not written in stone cannot be trusted xD.

For the uninitiated, I was an intern with the OpenMainframe Project in 2019 where I worked on the project to `Implement the Boost.Context Library for s390x architecture`. And all the interns from the OpenMainframe Project are funded by the Linux Foundation to attend a OpenSource conference as a Speaker. Thus, I got the chance to go to France to speak about my project at `Open Source Summit 2019, Lyon`

So Let's dive into it :)

## Initial Preparations

##### Mail and Ticket Booking

It was around 8th August, I recieved the mail from John about the Conference. The conference was about to be held in Lyon from October 28th - October 30th. And we were asked to connect with their travel company `Purple` to book our tickets. The hotel stay will be booked by Linux Foundation.

My first reaction was of disappointment because of the duration of the trip. I didn't wanted to stay only 2 days in France, I wanted to stay for more days. So I had this plan :P, Since the travel company was told by LF to book our tickets. I decied to try my luck and tell the travel company to book my tickets 7 days before the actual conference. And to my suprise, they accepted my date and the flights were booked for 22nd October. Hoooraaaah! :P

Finally I'll be going to France from 22nd October to 31st October. The only caveat being that I'll have to find my own hotel stay from 23rd - 27th. But the stipend earned during my internship was way more than enough to help me cover my expenses :)  

##### Getting the VISA Ready

Phewww! Remembering this process still gives me the scares. Honestly, I was scared to the core that my VISA might be rejected. There were two factors for this:

1. My shitty college
2. The VISA process myth

I had let's say, a manageable attendance (60%), because I had to handle two remote Internships simultaneously (Google Summer of Code and OpenMainframe Project). And when I went to my Head of Department for a `No Objection Certificate` that states that they are okay with me participating at the conference and that I am a valid student at the University, he upright refused stating my attendance :/ . This letter was important to give credibility to my VISA applicaiton. After a lot of pleading I was finally given a letter. I must really thank my Roomates Amit and Rishab for sticking with me during this whole fiasco. If you folks are reading this - Love to you <3

Applying for VISA is a whole another game. Collecting all the documents and going to the centre and applying, and the wait for the result is nerve whacking. To add to it, I got the verdict for my VISA the very next day. Unfortunately, it was a Saturday and the centres are closed on Saturday. I had to soak in this suspense for an entirely of two days. I had my suspicion that, the only reason I got the verdict within a day must be beacause the VISA was rejected. But luckily, The VISA was accepted and I was all set to go to France. \o/

After getting my VISA, I started making out my plan about the places I'll visit and making my hotel reservations.

My Plan was to:
1. 2 days Paris
2. 3 days going around the villages near Lyon
