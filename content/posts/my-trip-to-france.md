Bonjour Copains,

This post has been long overdue. I have been porcastinating for a long time, thanks to my laziness. But I have finally decided that this experience needs to be set in stone, because anything that's not written in stone cannot be trusted xD.

For the uninitiated, I was an intern with the OpenMainframe Project in 2019 where I worked on the project to `Implement the Boost.Context Library for s390x architecture`. And all the interns from the OpenMainframe Project are funded by the Linux Foundation to attend a OpenSource conference as a Speaker. Thus, I got the chance to go to France to speak about my project at `Open Source Summit 2019, Lyon`

So Let's dive into it :)

## Initial Preparations

##### Mail and Ticket Booking

It was around 8th August, I recieved the mail from John about the Conference. The conference was about to be held in Lyon from October 28th - October 30th. And we were asked to connect with their travel company `Purple` to book our tickets. The hotel stay will be booked by Linux Foundation.

My first reaction was of disappointment because of the duration of the trip. I didn't wanted to stay only 2 days in France, I wanted to stay for more days. So I had this plan :P, Since the travel company was told by LF to book our tickets. I decied to try my luck and tell the travel company to book my tickets 7 days before the actual conference. And to my suprise, they accepted my date and the flights were booked for 22nd October. Hoooraaaah! :P

Finally I'll be going to France from 22nd October to 31st October. The only caveat being that I'll have to find my own hotel stay from 23rd - 27th. But the stipend earned during my internship was way more than enough to help me cover my expenses :)  

##### Getting the VISA Ready

Phewww! Remembering this process still gives me the scares. Honestly, I was scared to the core that my VISA might be rejected. There were two factors for this:

1. My shitty college
2. The VISA process myth

I had let's say, a manageable attendance (60%), because I had to handle two remote Internships simultaneously (Google Summer of Code and OpenMainframe Project). And when I went to my Head of Department for a `No Objection Certificate` that states that they are okay with me participating at the conference and that I am a valid student at the University, he upright refused stating my attendance :/ . This letter was important to give credibility to my VISA applicaiton. After a lot of pleading I was finally given a letter. I must really thank my Roomates Amit and Rishab for sticking with me during this whole fiasco. If you folks are reading this - Love to you <3

Applying for VISA is a whole another game. Collecting all the documents and going to the centre and applying, and the wait for the result is nerve whacking. To add to it, I got the verdict for my VISA the very next day. Unfortunately, it was a Saturday and the centres are closed on Saturday. I had to soak in this suspense for an entirely of two days. I had my suspicion that, the only reason I got the verdict within a day must be beacause the VISA was rejected. But luckily, The VISA was accepted and I was all set to go to France. \o/

After getting my VISA, I started making out my plan about the places I'll visit and making my hotel reservations.

My Plan was to:
1. 2 days Paris
2. 3 days going around the villages near Lyon

## Day 0 [Oct 22]: Packing and Boarding the flight

The days preceeding this was very troublesome and hectic. Dad had to go through a heart stint to fix up some blockages in his heart and things at home weren't as good. The operation went well, but the operation is only the beginning of what has to come. The recovery takes much longer time and is more strainous than the operation. This period really took a toll on all our minds. There was also the time when I considered cancelling my trip. To summarize, I was pretty disturbed during this time.

Edit: But the day I am writing this, Dad has gotten strong and things are way way better now :)

So finally the day arrives, I was all packed and excited to visit Paris, explore the International Airport Lounges, the food on the flight and PARISSSS. If I recall correctly, I even bunked college that day. But as fate would have it, I developed sore throat out of the blue during afternoon. I thought sleeping will wear it off, I remember getting better in evening. I still had to pack my backpack. So I got to it - Luckily Ayush was in the room and he forcibly stuffed tons of eatables in my backpack(_I did not know the importance of this until later_).

Evening falls, Cab calls, Journey starts :P

The machinery that supports me seriously had some animosity with my happiness. My body gave in and I developed the symptoms of fever, cold and really really bad sore throat during my journey to the Bangalore Airport from hostel. My adrenaline of the visiting new land kept me going, it was until I reached the airport did I realise how worse my situation is. I immediately called the only one person who can fix everything. MOM comes to the rescue.

I told her my symptoms. She asked me to wait - She called up the doctor, got me some medicines, got a prescript signed by the doctor, sent me the photo and asked me to buy those meds. I ran to the pharmacy and ordered all the meds and lozenges(vicks tablet) and gulped my first dosage. Then called my maa - As it is customary, after asking about my health - I got scolded for being reckless and not attentive of body :P - Then was softly told to take care, eat the meds and rest for the first 2 days after going to PARIS. 

I then went to check-in my baggage, as you remember, I had a connecting flight - But I wanted to get down in PARIS. So I told the person who was checking in my baggage, to make sure that my bag lands in Paris and cancel my Lyon flight. After she said it's fine - I handed over my luggage and went ahead.

I was super bummed at my health situation. I would loose atleast 2 precious days. Anyway, I thought atleast I would be able to visit the International Lounges using my FOREX Card. I went to the place and and.. To my dismay, my FOREX card wasn't accepted - I misread the benefits of my card. My card only allowed free entry to Domestic Lounges. I was like WTF!!!!

[ Dejected GIF's ]

The start of my trip was looking gloomy and I lost all my hopes of having a pleasant time and honestly, I cursed at my luck. So dejected, I went on to order some food, from the restaurants. I was horrified when I saw the prices at the restaurants. The price of a single dish was equivalent to 5 full meals that I could have outside. I was so pissed at that time, I had no other option to buy something - to compensate for the meds I took. 

The only thing my buring throat would allow was a fricking 1000/- Indian rupee worth of soup which tasted like hot water with some vegetables. Ewww! Even thinking of that taste makes me wanna run to the chef and hit him with a hot pan.

[Hitting people with pan GIF] 

I later had a muffin to fix the taste of my mouth, though my throat resisted with all it's might to this foreign entry of sweet solid. I resisted back too, I wasn't going to give in to  Mr.SoreY Throathie. After finishing it, I could literally fells the meds and antibiotics kicking in action and making me drowsy. The commanded me to go and sit and let em take over my body. I obliged, little did I know the consequences of this.

My flight still had 1 hour for the boarding gate to open. I sat near the counter and as commanded by my microbes, I rested a bit and drifted off into my dream world. After what seemed like a nap of 5 minutes, I could faintly hear my name being called from an distant land - something nudged me and I awoke to a loud call of my name and this red sign.

[Final Boarding call GIF]

It took me few seconds to re-orient my perspective to the real world and ran as if my life depended on it to the boarding gate. It was the final boarding call and my name rang in the speakers above, I apologized profusely to the flight attendants and they understood my situation and welcomed me on board.

Ahh! Finally I got into the flight and then sat next to a lady, who scoffed at me - when I said I have a little cold and asked me to move away from her. I felt dejected at those comments, but in retrospective, I think what she said was the harsh truth, no one would like to sit next to a sick patient when travelling to a foreign land.

Finally after being seated in the flight, The flight was hugeeeee - Nothing as such as I have seen before (_I had only travelled twice in domestic flight - Fun Fact: Both those flights were funded by another company too :P_). I wished that - I wanted to get better so that I could enjoy the flight. But that's not how body works right? Anyway, thanks to my antibiotics, I was soon back in my very oddish dream world, only to be woken up my flight attendant to get some hot chocolate and meal. And then back again to the dream world.

The flight duration was around 10-11 hours. I woke up around 8 hours in flight after an uncomfortable bout of sleep. I watched some movie, then I blacked out again and woke up to the announcement of flight landing. 

Phewwww! Finally Finallly - I was landing on a foreign soil. I was in PARIS. The excitement kicked within me again. The adrenaline pumped back into me. I knew that I could take my bag - Get of the airport - And go to my hostel and sleep off my fever.

I deboarded the flight, The airport is huge and I was sacred. I felt really lonely to be honest, Strange people around me, Strange land and a language I don't understand. But I was here to overcome my fear of being in crowds. I had to overcome my cold feet. No use standing here. So I said to myself - What's the worse that could happen, I am far away from my people - No preying eyes, no expectations, I can try out as many new things as I can. So I pushed on - because I can't go back anyway. Remined myself the basics - Follow signs and ask for help. People wont eat you up :)

My health condition took a back seat now, and my logical and analytical brain drove me on. Followed the signs asked people for help(_Thanks to all the kind strangers for not chewing me up xD_) and finally reached the customs.

Customs was another thing I dreaded, I saw their faces and it was scary they scanned people. But I pushed on, showed my passport - Got scanned by vultures and then the gates OPENED.
