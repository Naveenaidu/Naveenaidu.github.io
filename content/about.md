Hello, Homosapein! 

I'm Naveen. Welcome to my tiny little space on the web :)


I'm currently working as a Haskell Engineer at [Hasura](https://hasura.io)

I do stuffs with computers and sometimes write about it here. And when the philosopher in me kicks in, I pen down my abstract thoughts on various subjects in the world that confuses me. I also like to write about various life lessons that I learn and sometimes use this place to brag about myself :P

I love reading Fantasy Fiction ( _Brandon Sanderson ❤️_), Watching Anime and Eating high sugar content food xD
