      <description>Hello There people :)
Welcome to my tiny weeny little space on web. I am Naveen. An undergraduate student from India. I study Computer Science. I do stuffs with computers and sometimes write about it here. And when the philosopher in me kicks in, I pen down my abstract thoughts on various subjects in the world that confuses me. I also like to write about various life lessons that I learn and sometimes use this place to brag about myself :P Cough!</description>
