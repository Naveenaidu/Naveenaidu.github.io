      <description>Heya Everyone,
This post is dedicated for my work done until now at Open Mainframe Project. For the unititated, I got selected for the Open Mainframe Project as an intern for the project Implementation of Boost.Context Module on s390x&amp;quot;.
What are all the weird terms on the above line? I promise you that I&amp;rsquo;ll explain all of the above term in details, when I do get some free time. For now, I&amp;rsquo;ll restrict myself to descrbing these terms in as simple manner as I can.</description>

      <description>Hola People!
It&amp;rsquo;s been raining since evening here. Though I&amp;rsquo;m not much of a rainy person, I like the cold breeze that the rain bring with it. The feeling of the cold breeze rustling through my hair and my face rejuvenates me. In one word, it&amp;rsquo;s orgasmic. I do not have any pictures of today, But I&amp;rsquo;ll make sure to capture a few when the weather turns sexy again.
Anyway this post is about the New Adventure that I have embarked upon.</description>
