        <title>A New Chapter</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hola People!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been raining since evening here. Though I’m not much of a rainy person, I 
like the cold breeze that the rain bring with it. The feeling of the
cold breeze rustling through my hair and my face rejuvenates me. In one word, it’s
orgasmic. I do not have any pictures of today, But I’ll make sure to capture
a few when the weather turns sexy again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway this post is about the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;New Adventure&lt;/code&gt; that I have embarked upon. This post is
kinda late. I’m glad to inform you that I have been selected as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;google-summer-of-code-student-2019-for-coala&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Summer of Code Student 2019 for &lt;em&gt;coala&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2-new-chapter/gsoc-acceptance.png&quot; alt=&quot;GSoC Acceptance&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;open-mainframe-projectlinux-foundation-internship&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Mainframe Project(Linux Foundation) Internship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2-new-chapter/omp-acceptance.png&quot; alt=&quot;GSoC Acceptance&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these are Open Source Projects and I get to work remotely from the 
comforts of my small lovely &lt;em&gt;hostel&lt;/em&gt; room. &lt;em&gt;Lovely? Really? Umm! Yeah it’s lovely
if you ignore the mess that my Cough! roomates Cough! make in the room xD&lt;/em&gt;.
I think I forgot to mention that I am a big Open Source afficianado. I love it.
It’s been the only platform that helped me grow. If I go on about why I love open
source, I’m sure this post will get really really lengthy. I’ll save that for
some time later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said, this blog will host my true feelings. I’m gonna go all out and express
them here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m happy that I did get into both of them. But at the same time, I’m scared too.
Scared because, I don’t know if I’ll be able to handle both of them at the same time.
I have never officially done an Internship before. I did make few small projects.
But this is on an entirely different level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The even more scarier part is that the timelines of GSOC and OMP(&lt;em&gt;Open Mainframe Project&lt;/em&gt;)
clashes. And at the same time, I have my University finals to manage. Since,
I’ll be graduating next year, My Placement sessions are about to begin as well.
Will have to prepare for all of these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next few months (May - Sepetember), I’ll have to manage the
following thing simultaneously:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Google Summer of Code&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open Mainframe Project Internship&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;University Finals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Placement Preparations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll tell you the entire story about my selection into the two projects later.
For now, it’s really important for me to contemplate about the choices I need to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I initially thought that I wouldn’t take on GSoC and would only do OMP. The reasons
might sound trivial to few/many, but OMP paid a stipend which is almost the double of
GSoC. I needed the money for my personal reason(which I might disclose in some later posts).
But I couldn’t go through with this decision. I mean, GSoC was/is the projec that I had
spent months working on. I couldn’t let it slip away - Not after all the work I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next viable choice was to leave OMP and only do GSoC. I couldn’t do this either.
OMP project gave me the oppurtunity to explore the domain of Mainframes 
and code in Assembly and get to the real Bare Level of Computer,&lt;em&gt;Another area
of my interest&lt;/em&gt;. And also because of the Monteray reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I started thinking. Is it necessary for me to &lt;em&gt;abandon&lt;/em&gt; one of them? 
What’s the core reasoning behind it. The only reason I could come up with was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was scared that I might be over stressed and fail in one of them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you go, Me overthinking again. Duh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll put my situation in a more concise way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;I want to work on both the projects but I was scared that I might not 
be able to do justice to both of them and fail miserably in both.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See there it is bright and clear. The only problem I had there was &lt;em&gt;FEAR&lt;/em&gt;. Fear
of losing everything. This is something, that I suffer with. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mr.Fear&lt;/code&gt; always 
holds me tight whenever I am about to start any new thing. Or If I may, 
whenever I try to do something that’ll push me out of my comfort zone. I don’t
know, if it’s common for all the people out there, but it is something that we
all must be aware of. It’s almost the case with me that this &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mr.Fear&lt;/code&gt; has 
always stopped me from taking on new oppurtunites. I can now recall of countless
situations where if only I had kicked Mr.Fear in his butt and grabbed upon them,
I would have been a different person now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll like to tell the readers that there can be many different kind of fears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I categorize the fear in two kinds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A good fear - &lt;em&gt;Anything that’ll keep us alive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A bad fear  - &lt;em&gt;Anything that stops our personal developement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bad fear is something we need to be &lt;del&gt;rid&lt;/del&gt; aware of. I do not say rid because
as human beings, it’s hard to get remove a particular emotion from our system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this time, I’ve had it enough. I won’t let &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mr.Fear&lt;/code&gt; decide my future. I won’t
let him stop me from stepping out of my comfort zone. This time, I have decided 
that no matter what, I’ll be doing all the 4 things mentioned above simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, It does look like a humungous task list. But I would never really know my 
real potential until I actually try this on. I have always beleived that,
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is we who put barriers to our potential and segregate between what's
achievable and what's not&lt;/code&gt;. This time, I will take on this challenge and find
out upto what extent can I break. I want to break myself - Because until I do
this, I’ll always keep setting my standards low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, what’s the worst that can happen - I’ll fail - But atleast I’ll fail
trying. One less regret in life :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s decided then - I will be doing both GSoC and OMP at the same time, and 
complete both of them succesfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not at a stage where I can tell the readers what to do and what not to do. I
can also ask you to think about it. If you go through these same thoughts of
self doubt and fear, the only way to overcome is to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Just Get Started&lt;/code&gt;. I always
think about the worst that can happen. In most of the cases, the worst case isn’t
very scary once we accept the fact, that we might fail. But there are high chances
that we will succeed as well. So, whenever you are in doubt, just start doing it,
once things start getting clearer - The fear will wear off on it’s own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck ^^&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sayonara until my next blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending 3 days of planning, managing all the four things now looks realistic
and doable. The fear, though still present - it’s magnitude is very very less.
The bad fear has now turned into good fear and I know, this will push me to complete
the challenge that I have taken up :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>First post</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello There people :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my tiny weeny little space on web. I am Naveen. An undergraduate
student from India. I study Computer Science. I do stuffs with computers and 
sometimes write about it here. And when the philosopher in me kicks in, I pen 
down my abstract thoughts on various subjects in the world that confuses me. I 
also like to write about various life lessons that I learn and sometimes use 
this place to brag about myself :P &lt;em&gt;Cough! Cough! If you noticed, I just copy
pasted the description of homepage here :P Engineers are lazy ^^&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE: I TEND TO WRITE VERY LONG POSTS - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You wouldn’t believe me but I have been trying to set up the blog post since
past &lt;strong&gt;4 months&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
	&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/wxw2e19ZMsjio&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;/iframe&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;a href=&quot;https://giphy.com/gifs/wxw2e19ZMsjio&quot;&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah! You read it right. Fucking 4 months. And I finally set up my blog last
month. &lt;em&gt;Why? Why? Did i take so long to set up one simple blog Not like it’s 
great or anything.&lt;/em&gt; Well, my dear friend. It’s not my fault (It never is :P),
Blame the choices. And my high expectations. I tend to do this often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading so many interesting blogs and being mesmerised by their shiny 
design I wanted to make a blog similar to them. So I set out on the journey to 
create a mind boggling fantastic blog - Something completely out of ordinary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
	&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/dWhHUkuWnGxFK&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;358&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;a href=&quot;https://giphy.com/gifs/full-house-bitch-please-dWhHUkuWnGxFK&quot;&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know where to start. No way on Thano’s Earth would I ever resort to 
building the website by myself (&lt;em&gt;Insider Fact: I HATE web developement - Never
made sense to me&lt;/em&gt;). So I choose the easy way out - &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Jekyll + Github Pages&lt;/code&gt;. 
Atleast I thought it was going to be easy, I always underestimate things.
It was PAIN in the ASS. I realised that I really really suck at anything
related to web .And here, I dreamt that one day - I’ll get the entire internet
down - There goes my plan down the drain &lt;em&gt;atleast for now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah! I finally succeded at setting up the Github Page and understanding the
basics of Jekyll. But I still had no themes on it. It was just a normal
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Hello World!&lt;/code&gt; text. Now Now - comes the actual and real cause of the delay.
&lt;strong&gt;CHOICES&lt;/strong&gt; - There were so many interesting choices. Each and every choice
was in someway better than the rest. But nothing really clicked my heart. 
Mind You! I set my expectations to a very very high bar. I must also inform you 
that I actually tried out 5 jekyll themes before this one xD.
&lt;em&gt;Woah! man&lt;/em&gt;. Still, Still - I did not like any of those. I was worrying about
the scalability about the blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
	&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/ZqlvCTNHpqrio&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;259&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;a href=&quot;https://giphy.com/gifs/laughing-despicable-me-minions-ZqlvCTNHpqrio&quot;&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t Laugh!&lt;/em&gt; Every person has the right to dream :P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the story, I was pissed off after a week. Like really really pissed out,
any more theme change and I would literally have a mental breakdown &lt;em&gt;Don’t 
be so overdramatic dude&lt;/em&gt;. Yeah Yeah OKay Fine!. Anyway - I finally decided that
it can’t go on this way. Either I need to get my expectations down and become
realistic or I can say Sayonara to my Blog. I did the former. I set down my
expectation, choose a minimalistic theme and here I am blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hurrah! After 4 months - I had my own webpage and a blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once lesson that I understood from this ordeal is: 
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JUST DO IT&lt;/code&gt;, I realised that we spend most of out time in thinking about the
outcomes and the ways that we want to achieve things, and in this whole process
the implementation get’s lost either because we find it very difficult or we 
loose our interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - Don’t overthink, If you plan to do something - just put on your shoes 
and do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, that the story of my setting up of the blog is over. I would just like to
tell you, the reader(&lt;em&gt;I’m pretty sure the only person/thing who would read it would
be the bots scrawling over the internet xD&lt;/em&gt;) that I would be using this place
to put in all my un organized thoughts. So do not expect any posts to be of 
great quality.  I generally do this in my diary but now that i spend most of the
time on my laptop - It’s easier this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing down my abstract ideas have always helped me come to a conclusion. So 
that is what I’m gonna do here. That being said, I do write some nice stuff.
If you are up for the challenge to read through my abstract ideas and see how
they become clear in the idea, I would be more than happy to welcome you 
on-board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it for now - Maybe someother day - I’ll let in more about myself.&lt;/p&gt;
